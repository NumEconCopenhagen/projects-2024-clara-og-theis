    "We consider a simple Nash bargaining problem between two bargainers/players: $N = \\{1,2\\}$. In our case, the two players are a firm and a worker who bargain about splitting the productivity of the worker in a one shot game. The players either reach an agreement on the distribution of the surplus or fail to reach an agreement in which they receive the threat point $D=(d_1,d_2)$. $d_1$ can be thought for as unemployment benefits which the bargained wage has to exceed for the contract to be entered into.
