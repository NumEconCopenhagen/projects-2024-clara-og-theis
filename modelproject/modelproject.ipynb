    "We consider a simple Nash Bargaining problem betweem two agents: $N = \\{1,2\\}$. In our case two agents are a firm and a worker who bargain about splitting the productivity of the worker. The two agents has the possibility of agreeing on the distribution of the surplus of the labour. Another possibility is that they cannot agree on a wage and then they will receive $D=(d_1,d_2)$. $d_1$ can be thought for as reflecting unemployment benefit or the costs of searching for a job, which the bargained wage has to exceed for the contract to be entered into. We assume that $d_2=0$ because of free entry and a large number of firms. "
