# Model project

Project Title:
"Exploring Wage Negotiations Using the Nash Bargaining Model"

Project Description:
This project delves into wage determination through the lens of the Nash Bargaining Model. It simulates and analyzes wage outcomes under different bargaining powers and external conditions. The model accounts for various economic scenarios including the impact of minimum wage laws, varying worker productivity, and bargaining power dynamics on the wage distribution. By utilizing a numerical approach and analytical solutions, this project offers insights into how wages are negotiated and determined in theoretical economic settings.

Results:
The outcomes of this analysis are accessible via interactive simulations and visualizations in the Jupyter notebook: modelproject.ipynb. Users can interact with the model parameters through a graphical user interface to observe how changes in parameters like bargaining power, minimum wage, and worker productivity affect wage distributions and bargaining outcomes.

Datasets:
This analysis is purely theoretical and does not employ external datasets. Instead, it uses simulated data generated within the model to explore the implications of the Nash Bargaining theory. The model parameters are set to reflect a range of plausible economic conditions.

Dependencies:
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project relies on the following Python libraries:

    NumPy for numerical operations.
    Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
    SciPy for optimization and solving the Nash bargaining model.
    SymPy for symbolic mathematics to derive analytical solutions.
    IPython and ipywidgets for creating interactive elements in the Jupyter notebook.

This setup ensures that the project is fully reproducible and allows for interactive exploration of theoretical economic models, providing a dynamic tool for understanding complex wage negotiation dynamics.
