Project Title:
"Wage formation in a Nash Bargaining game"

Project Description:
This project delves into wage formation through the lens of the Nash Bargaining Model. The model is solved analytically as well as numerically and under different values of the worker's bargaining power. Using the numerical solution to the bargaining problem a wage distribution is simulated. As an extension to the model a minimum wage is introduced and its effects on the wage distirbution is analyzed. 

Results:
The outcomes of this analysis are accessible via interactive simulations and visualizations in the Jupyter notebook: modelproject.ipynb. Users can interact with the model parameters through a graphical user interface to observe how changes in parameters like bargaining power affect bargaining outcomes.

Datasets:
This analysis is purely theoretical and does not employ external datasets. Instead, it uses simulated data generated within the model to explore the implications of the Nash Bargaining theory. The model parameters are set to reflect a range of plausible economic conditions.

Dependencies:
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project relies on the following Python libraries:

    NumPy for numerical operations.
    Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
    SciPy for optimization and solving the Nash bargaining model.
    SymPy for symbolic mathematics to derive analytical solutions.
    IPython and ipywidgets for creating interactive elements in the Jupyter notebook.

This setup ensures that the project is fully reproducible and allows for interactive exploration of theoretical economic models, providing a dynamic tool for understanding complex wage negotiation dynamics.
