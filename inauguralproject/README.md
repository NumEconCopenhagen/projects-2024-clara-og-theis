# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**The project:** We consider an exchange economy consisting of two consumers and two goods. The project seeks to explore the allocation of the goods as well as the utility of the consumers in different optimization problems. For example, we consider a case where A is the market maker and a case where there is a utilitarian social planner. Furthermore, we find the market equilibrium allocation depending on the initial endowments.
