# Exam project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [exam_2024.ipynb](exam_2024.ipynb) which refers to the file [Problem_1.py](Problem_1.py), [Problem_2.py](Problem_2.py) and [Problem_3.py](Problem_3.py).

**Project Description:** 
Problem 1. Production Economy and CO2 Taxation: In this problem we analyze a production economy with two firms producing different goods and a single consumer. The questions examine the impact of CO2 taxation on optimal firm behavior, consumer utility, and market clearing conditions, aiming to find equilibrium prices and maximize social welfare.

Problem 2. Career Choice Model: In this problem we explore the decision making process of graduates choosing between different career tracks. It simulates the expected and realized utilities of career choices based on personal expectations and peer influences, considering the option to switch careers after initial choices.

Problem 3. Barycentric Interpolation: In this problem we try to approximate the value of a function at given random points using barycentric coordinates within a unit square. It seeks to compute the barycentric coordinates for triangles formed by the closest points and evaluate the function's approximation accuracy.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the following libraries are necessary:

    numpy
    types
    pandas
    matplotlib
    scipy
