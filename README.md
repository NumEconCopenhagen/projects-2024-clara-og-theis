1. **Inaugural project**: We consider an exchange economy consisting of two consumers and two goods. The project seeks to explore the allocation of the goods as well as the utility of the consumers in different optimization problems. For example, we consider a case where A is the market maker and a case where there is a utilitarian social planner. Furthermore, we find the market equilibrium allocation depending on the initial endowments.
2. **Data project**: the project investigates the total work effort in Denmark compared to other OECD countries by examining trends in employment rates and average working hours per person employed from 2008 to 2022. Specifically, the analysis looks to understand the labor market dynamics in Denmark and the broader OECD nations reflected in these trends. We fetch data from the OECD Database and show that though Denmark currently has low average working hours per person employed compared to other OECD countries the employment rate is relatively large.
3. **Model project**: This project delves into wage determination through the lens of the Nash Bargaining Model. It simulates and analyzes wage outcomes under different bargaining powers and external conditions. The model accounts for various economic scenarios including the impact of minimum wage laws, varying worker productivity, and bargaining power dynamics on the wage distribution. By utilizing a numerical approach and analytical solutions, this project offers insights into how wages are negotiated and determined in theoretical economic settings.
