# Data analysis project

**Project Title: "Analysing work effort in Denmark compared to other OECD countries"**

**Project Description:**
This project investigates the total work effort in Denmark compared to other OECD countries by examining trends in employment rates and average working hours per person employed from 2008 to 2022. Specifically, the analysis looks to understand the labor market dynamics in Denmark and the broader OECD nations reflected in these trends.

**Results:**
The findings of this project are documented and can be explored through interactive visualizations and computations in the provided Jupyter notebook: dataproject.ipynb.

**Datasets Employed:**

    Level of GDP per capita and productivity - Average hours worked per person employed
        Source: OECD Database
        Description: This dataset includes annual data on average working hours per person employed measured in hours per year across OECD countries.

    Short-Term Labour Market Statistics - Employment Rate
        Source: OECD Database
        Description: This dataset provides annual data on employment rates, detailing the percentage of the population aged 15-64 who are employed, with specific breakdowns for females, males, and overall employment rates in each OECD country.

**Dependencies:**
The analysis is conducted using Python, and aside from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the following libraries are necessary:

    Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
    Pandasdmx to fech OECD data. 
    Matplotlib for data visualization.
    GeoPandas for geographical data processing and mapping.
    Jupyter Notebook for interactive computational documentation.

This configuration ensures that all visualizations and computational analyses are reproducible and interactive, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data.
